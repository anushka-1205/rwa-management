# RWA Management System

The project is designed bearing in mind the importance of a well-maintained community and improvement in the working of a society and its RWA group. The project is based on Python and SQL.

It provides a digital way to take care of a residential society effortlessly. We have tried to make a user-friendly program where one can enter a new record, display specific records, and perform other functions with the help of Data Files or SQL connecting with Python. A section shares information related to the RWA group, such as the members and their roles; it also takes inputs from the user for any inquiry. A billing department is present to manage the several fees in the society; a grocery department supervises the shops for the residents' convenience. 

Another sub-topic superintends the events that take place to have a more engaging experience among the people. It also touches on the requirements for an orphanage or a nursing home that is made for people in need. This project will help an RWA group overcome the troubles they face due to storage and allow the people to work for the betterment of their society with minimal labor.
